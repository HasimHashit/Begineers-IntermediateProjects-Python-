#This is a guessing game built with random and time
# problems with the game is the human is always at a disavantage 
# the human has to guess the number the computer picks
#good luck getting a point very hard.....
# do improve the code and if you want it implemented holla i'll add it to the existing version do comment in 
#do comment in your Social Handles......

  #we just created a random generator for the computer 

  #next we create one for the human but humans arent like computer we are bad at following rules....
  #how do we make it the user follows the rules we could:
  # receive an integer input from the user
  # -use a range 
  # - and a comparsion operator 

  #human number picker:
  humanNumber = eval(input('Enter a number from 0 - 100 :')) #here we ask the user to input a value
  if humanNumber in range(0, 101): #here we check to see if the user inputted number is in the range of 0 - 100
      print(humanNumber)
  elif humanNumber not in range(0, 101):
      print('You picked the wrong digit pls try again') # this code only runs if the human inputs the wrong value   

  #now we need to check if the computer value is  equal to the human value
